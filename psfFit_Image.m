function [ params ] = psfFit_Image( img, varargin )
% Short usage: params = psfFit_Image( img, param_init );
% Full usage: [ params, exitflag ] = psfFit_Image( img, param_init, param_optimizeMask, useIntegratedGauss, hWinSize, sigma_init )
%  Fit multiple spot candidates in a given image with a gaussian point spread function model.
% 
% Coordinate convention: Integer coordinates are centered in pixels. I.e.
% the position xpos=3, ypos=5 is exactly the center of pixel img(5,3). Thus
% pixel center coordinates range from 1 to size(img,2) for x and 1 to
% size(img,1) for y coordinates.
%
% Use empty matrix [] for parameters you don't want to specify.
%
% Input:
%   img        - Image to fit to. (internally converted to double)
%   param_init - Initial values PxN to fit N spot candidates in the given image with
%                initial conditions for P parameters. At least position [xpos; ypos] 
%                must be specified (P>=2). You can specify up to [xpos;ypos;A;BG;sigma]. 
%                If negative values are given, the fitter estimates a value for that parameter.
%   param_optimizeMask - Must be true(1)/false(0) for every parameter [xpos,ypos,A,BG,sigma]. 
%                Parameters with value 'false' are not fitted. | default: ones(5,1) -> 'optimize all'
%   useIntegratedGauss - Wether to use pixel integrated gaussian or not | default: 'false'
%   useMLErefine - Use Poissonian noise based maximum likelihood estimation after
%                  least squares fit. Make sure to input image intensities in photons 
%                  for this to make sense. | default: false
%   hWinSize   - window around each candidate is (2*hWinsize+1)x(2*hWinsize+1) | default: 5
%   sigma_init - For convenience sigma can also be given as an extra parameter.
%               This simply sets all candidates initial sigma to sigma_init. 
%               This overwrites the value given in param_init.
%
% Output
%   params     -  Fitted parameters 6xN. Columns are in order
%                 [xpos; ypos; A; BG; sigma; exitflag].
%             
%           The last row 'exitflag' returns the state of optimizer. 
%           Positive = 'good'. Negative = 'bad'.
%             1 - CONVERGENCE
%            -1 - NO_CONVERGENCE
%            -2 - FAILURE
